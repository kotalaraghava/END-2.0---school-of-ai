Question/Answer Dataset
=======================

Question/Answer dataset generated by students who took undergraduate natural language processing courses taught by Noah Smith at Carnegie Mellon and Rebecca Hwa at the University of Pittsburgh during Spring 2008, Spring 2009, and Spring 2010.

There are three directories, one for each year of students: S08, S09, and S10.

The file "question_answer_pairs.txt" contains the questions and answers. The first line of the file contains 
column names for the tab-separated data fields in the file. This first line follows:

ArticleTitle    Question        Answer  DifficultyFromQuestioner        DifficultyFromAnswerer  ArticleFile

Field 1 is the name of the Wikipedia article from which questions and answers initially came.<br />
Field 2 is the question.<br />
Field 3 is the answer.<br />
Field 4 is the prescribed difficulty rating for the question as given to the question-writer. <br />
Field 5 is a difficulty rating assigned by the individual who evaluated and answered the question, <br />
which may differ from the difficulty in field 4.<br />
Field 6 is the relative path to the prefix of the article files. html files (.htm) and cleaned <br />
text (.txt) files are provided.
